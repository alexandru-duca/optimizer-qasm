# optimizer-qasm

This repository contains the benchmark quantum circuits by
[njross](https://github.com/njross/optimizer) in the original
[Quipper](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/) format. Circuits without subroutines have been translated into
[OpenQASM 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenQASM).
